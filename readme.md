# Travel Application Design

This project is from iOS 12 & Swift 5 - App Design, UI/UX plus Development course by Gwinyai Nyatsoka.

[Course Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/app-design-uiux-plus-ios-development/)

## Topics

- `No Storyboards` and `Xibs`. everything done it in programmatic way unlike in course where author prefer storyboard for this design.
- `UICollectionView` inside `UITableViewCell` in programmatic way.

- `Shadow and Rounded corners` in programmatic way. we usually have problem with rounded corners when we use shadow. for that, we have created secondary view as per instructions from `Gwinyai Nyatsoka`

## Drawbacks

- Not a clean code.

- Not maintained standards like creating and reusing views, using architecture like MVC, MVVM etc..,

## App Design
